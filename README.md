 I did this exercise as part of my studies with React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) by Maximillian Schwarzmuller https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux
 
 In this exercise, I used and practiced: 
  - React components, 
  - React props, passing data via props 
  - structuring the React project files
  - writing JSX code, 
  - adding normal JavaScript logic to components
  
  
To run locally: 
- Download the project files into a local folder 
- Navigate into this project folder in the terminal 
- In terminal type 'npm install' . This will install the node modules packages and recreates the node_modules folder. 
- In terminal type 'npm start' to start the server and open the project in your browser.
